# 🙆‍♀️ Careers Resources For Developers 

👋🏻 I'm Jean-Michel. I have been a developer for almost 15 years, and now I'm agent for developer careers.

I find it infuriating when talented developers couldn't find the companies that needed them because bad hiring practices were creating an heavy fog of non-sense between them.

I think I can help you in your careers, for that the first step would be to drop me an email

>  jean-michel@goodrecruiter.eu 

But if you are too shy to send an email, here are the best resources I could find on careers stuff, they are the ones I am using personally.


## My own articles on DEV.to

Follow me here [**Jean-Michel Fayard 🇫🇷🇩🇪🇬🇧🇪🇸🇨🇴 - DEV Community**](https://dev.to/jmfayard)

I wrote almost 100 articles but those are maybe a good place to start

- [“What is your current salary?” is a red flag that you don’t want to work here - DEV Community](https://dev.to/jmfayard/what-is-your-current-salary-is-a-red-flag-that-you-don-t-want-to-work-here-3aji)

But there is way more to developers careers than Job Hunting.
What made a big different in my life was to become good at learning, at writing, at contributing to Open Source, and just meeting cool people.
