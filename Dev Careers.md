# 🙆‍♀️ Careers Resources For Developers 

👋🏻 I'm Jean-Michel. I have been a developer for almost 15 years, and now I'm agent for developer careers.

I find it infuriating when talented developers couldn't find the companies that needed them because bad hiring practices were creating an heavy fog of non-sense between them.

I think I can help you in your careers, for that the first step would be to drop me an email

But if you are too shy to send an email, here are the best resources I could find on careers stuff, they are the ones I am using personally.


## My own articles on DEV.to
