I am big fan of explaining stuff to five years old because you push your limits as a pedagogue. 

5 years old can understand many things you wouldn't expect if you exchange complex words for story telling.

So I'm going to explain my last project, whose main credits go to [Piotr KrzemiÅ„ski](https://github.com/krzema12) in both geek and greek editions.

## Geek Mythology

If you are a DEV, this is the story we tell you :

_[typesafegithub/github-workflows-kt](https://github.com/typesafegithub/github-workflows-kt/) is a tool for creating GitHub Actions workflows in a type-safe script, helping you to build robust workflows for your GitHub projects without mistakes, with pleasure, in Kotlin_.

**You won't go back to YAML!**

## Greek Mythology

It may sound tricky to explain type safety and YAML to a 5 years old

But those little devils are smart, so let's try.

_Dear 5yo_,

_Typesafe Github Workflows are just like your favorite story from the greek mythology_. 

_Odysseus and its crew, we call them the devs, have worked hard and want to go home_.

_But while they are heading home, a terror invade their hearts. They hear a seducing song from the sirens on an island called GitHub.__

__That song is written in a terrifying foreign language that pretend to be a programming language__.

ðŸ˜± **YAML** ðŸ˜±. 

_The devs in the boat fear that it may be the very last sound they hear before their death_.

_There is in missing space in that YAML_.

_That may not sound much to you, but the YAML world is a very unstable world. That missing space changes everything and meances to destroy the whole world around the DEVs_.

_But Odysseus, just like my project, smartly put wax in the devs's ears,  so they don't have to hear any of that scary YAML stuff, remain unaffected and go home safely_.

_Odeysseus and my project have to hear the YAML, and we struggle to resist, but in the end we live to tell the tale._
