The title speaks for itself but you are such a bunch of loosers that I will do a FAQ anyway. 

**Who should read this article ?**

Everyone should always read my articles.
At least if you don't want to be a looser.

**What do I know about my intended audience ?**

That they should rewrite everything in Rust in 2024 unless they want to stay a bunch of loosers in 2024. 

**What is a looser and what is a real developer ?**

Basically it's like black and white, either you are a looser or you are a [real developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman).

**What is Rust in 2024 ?**

Same as Rust in 2023, one year older. 

Long story short, it's a programming language with awesome features that you should rewrite everything with in 2024.

**Why in 2024 ?**

Great for SEO.

**What do I mean by everything ?**

Everything where code is involved where Rust awesome features might become handy at some point in 2024.

**How much time and money would that cost ?**

I don't know but I know that staying a looser for your whole life wil cost you even more. 

**It's loser with one o**

Only in Real English.
I speak Looser English, meaning French.


**How do I use Rust on the front end ?**

**How can I stop being a looser ?**

Listen to the wisdom of a great Founding Father who made America a Democracy and not only a Republic.

**What should my readers do from here ?**

Rewrite everything in Rust in 2024.

**What if I prefer to make my own choices in my own context ?**

**I am a looser too, but Why Rust though ? I still don't get it**

Well I don't know much about Rust to be honest, but I watched a video from @ThePrimeTimeagen on YouTube where he explained that Rust is great.

I didn't really understood why or when of for whom Rust is great, but @ThePrimeTimeagen is smart and here is Why.

- @ThePrimeTimeagen works at Netfliksse, unlike loosers like you and me.
- @ThePrimeTimeagen once spoke about an article of mine and I liked that.
- @ThePrimeTimeagen also told me that I was an annoying junior developer, and that I m not qualified to have an opinion about TDD. And he is 100% correct, I am not.

What I don't get is whether my article's title is a clickbait or a scambait.

Maybe he can clarify ? I will ask on Twitter.
