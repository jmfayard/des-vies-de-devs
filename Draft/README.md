# We Shall Improve Hiring Somewhat

Becoming a good developer is like becoming a pianist. It's fun and good and rewarding. It's also an awful lots of learning and tedious practice. It is inherently hard.

But, if you want make that your career, why is "everything else" so difficult ?

## Why ?

Below are some of the questions that have been living rent-free in my head for more than a decade.

- Why do developers with skills and companies who needs those skills have such a hard time finding each other ?
- Why does job hunting feel like we are students applying for college and not professionals finding out whether it makes sense to work together ?
- Why do we hear all the time that everyone should learn to code, when in reality it's better to do it if you are a young college-educated english-speaking male ?
- Why do developers dread job hunting if it's true that our skills are in high demand ?
- Why is imposter syndrome poisoning so many of us ?
- Why do devs talk about hiring processes at HypeStartups like if it was the 12 Labours of Hercules ?
- Why did Google, the dream company of my youth, decide that a good hiring criteria would the ability to answer brain teasers ?
- Why do devs accept to spend their nights and weekends on taking home challenges ?
- Why are salary negotiations the way they are ?
- Why ghosting ?
- Why are we told to use LinkedIn which is bad at its supposed job ?
- Why do some people lash out in anger every time we suggest that a job interview at a given company went poorly ?
- Why do companies focus on finding good candidates and not good developers ?

## How can we FIX IT ?

That's a great question, thanks.

For my part, I have decided to do something about it, and after talking with many many people over the year, I have decided to share what I have learned so far in public.

In order to help better practices spread, I have decided to Open Source and centralise all my content here.
