# Facebook is a global catastrophe for mental health. 
_My career-related content is now [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/jmfayard/agentdouble.dev)_.

  
Here are some findings of the effect it has on the most vulnerable of us  
  
"For some users quitting social networking sites is comparable to quitting smoking or giving up alcohol"  
  
"Drugs like alcohol and tobacco could not keep up with social networking sites regarding their level of addictiveness"  
  
"In 2014, Facebook went down for about 30 minutes, prompting several users to call emergency services"  
  
"Adolescents reporting higher ADHD symptoms positively predicted Facebook addiction, persistent negative attitudes about the past and that the future"  
  
"People who are feeling suicidal use the internet to search for suicide methods. Websites provide graphic details and information on how to take your own life. This cannot be right."  
  
"Facebook has been criticized for making people envious and unhappy due to the constant exposure to positive yet unrepresentative highlights of their peers."  
  
"As many as one out of three people actually feel worse and less satisfied with their lives after visiting the site."  
  
"Vacation photos and social interaction are the biggest sources of envy. Visitors who contributed the least tended to feel the worst."  
  
"The more people used Facebook, the worse they felt afterwards"  
"20 percent of divorce petitions included references to Facebook"  
  
"High levels of Facebook use could result in Facebook-related conflict and breakup/divorce"*
