She's absolutely right from the candidate perspective

But the company perspective is really wrong indeed. It doesn't make sense at all.
## Counter arguments

I want to make a very obvious point that compnaies must hire develoeprs by looking at how good they are at developing. And not how good they are at CVing.

Why would you not hire a developer that is good for your company for the frivoulous reason that his CV is "not good" according to vague subjective unknown criterias unrelated to what he does in his real job?

It's not the candidate job to be a candidate. They are not paid for that. The companies are the professionals and they are paid for that. They need to do their job right.

**The choice of text colors and fonts in a resume can significantly impact its professionalism.**

That doesn't make sense, if you are hiring a backend developer, given you have hired her, why would you care how the colors were ? Thats's completly unrelated to her job. If companies hire like that, they don't hire right.

*_It’s important to understand that recruiters often have limited time to review each resume. *_

That doesn't make sense, recruiters spend months finding a developer.

**While the Europass CV format has been widely used for years, it’s increasingly viewed as outdated in today’s dynamic job market**

No source like alwyays.  
Everyone has a different strong opinion on how to do the CV right because they are no criteria of success.

**False Information**  
The CV itself forces you to "lie", see my separate comment.

**Irrelevant and Really Old Employment History**  
I like this one

**Too Much Personal Info**  
What does too much mean and for whom ? What is personal ?  
For example my ex boss put that he loves playing guitar and plays in a band.  
I am guessing this is irrelvant in many places.  
But he ended up working at SondCloud and that was very relevant in a profesional way.  
Everyone there is a musician.

*_Inappropriate Email Address *_  
Ok once again, let's imagine my backend developer is hired, why do we care which email address she used ? Is that a good criteria of a good backend developer ? Are you hiring the candidate or the developer ? I know plenty of developers who have a weird sense of humor.

**Questionable Work Experience**  
What if I went to a company, it was a mistake, but I learnt something very important in it and wil not do the mistake again ?  
Again the CV doesn't allow you to say anything meaningful, it's a complete fog.

**Past Salary Info – A big NO**  
Absolutely.

**Unnecessary Info About Previous Employers and Experience**  
Agree with those two.

**Personal Hobbies and Interests**  
"Given the limited space on a resume"  
But you can just use any format that is not so limited.  
There is no law of the nature that you must use a format that does his job so poorly.

**Fluff and Buzzwords**  
Terms like “results-oriented,” “team-player,” or “hardworking” are often overused in resumes and have become clichés.

Here you are right.  
But why do you think people use those words ?  
Do you think they speak like that in the real word or that people have been trained them to write like this for the CV specficaly ?

**Errors. Nothing undermines a professional resume more than typos and grammatical errors.**

That one is actually cruel if you really means it.  
Does that mean you wouldn't hire anyone who has dyslexia ? Who comes from another country ? Poor background ?  
Does that means that those people deserves to be jobless and miserable ?  
Of course you don't mean that.

I can go on and on but I think you get my point.

The supposed goodnes of a CV is just a very poor hiring criteria for hiring a good developer and tech companies need to tech recruiting seriously and train their recruiters.

## Lying on your CV

**False Information**  
_Never lie on your resume. Overstating your position or qualifications can backfire, especially if the truth surfaces later. Never lie on your resume. Being honest and transparent about your skills and experiences is the best policy. Integrity speaks volumes. Always._

It's nothing against you, but unfortunately the CV itself is such a bad medium that it's barely possible to be honest, unless you had the Perfect Life.

And believe it or not, the reality of life is that Shit Happens.

For example, I live in France and would you believe it or not, there is much less than 95% of people speaking perfectly English.  
Yet, if you believed the database of resumes, and take them at face value, that the impression you would have.  
Now the reason people "lie" about that is that if they don't "lie" about it, well then they don't get a job and then the fridge is empty.  
So I would say lying in general is bad, indeed, but the CV format strucurally forces you to "lie", meaning finding a way to pump up without technically lying.  
Therefore the narrator who writes the CV feels unreliable, because obviously he needs to fill the fridge.

That's just a simple example everyone can relate with.

I have a personal more hardcore example. What happend when you get a mental health crisis and a trauma ? How do you write that on a CV ? Do you let the gaps empty ? Do you fill them with truth ? Do you lie about it ?

Personally I lied and that's what the right thing to do.

TLDR: The CV is an obsolete thing from the industrial era.

## Why it's wrong from the company perspective

I understand what is said here, it totally makes sense from the perspective of a developer given the current context of how companies are hiring.

What I disagree with is another level.  
I imagine a world where tech companies hire good developers and not good candidates.  
Being a good candidate meaning here being able to get the job.  
What companies actually need is someone who can do the job.  
And getting the job is mostly about career coaching, marketing and sales.  
Companies need good developers, not good candidates.

What I mean by that is that the correlation between being a good candidate and a good developer is very very poor.

What I say is that I think the way most tech companies are doing wrong and they must change.  
I think we are allowed to improve tech hiring somewhat.  
It doesn't work well and everyone knows it.

That's what I have written about since 3 years and will continue in the future.

Your tips completely make sense in the current context. It's the current context that doesn't make sense.
